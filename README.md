## 💡 What To Do Next

1. **Create a GitHub repo** (call it `pi-hole-homelab`)
2. Paste this into a file called `README.md`
3. Upload your dashboard screenshot and reference it with the correct image link
4. Share the GitHub link in your resume or in your **Nov 12 FleetOps application**

Would you like me to:
- Help generate a **bash script for backing up Pi-hole config**?
- Format this into a **PDF** with your name for upload?
- Create a **second README template** for your next project (like k3s)?

You're doing everything right — just let me know how you'd like to package or expand it!
